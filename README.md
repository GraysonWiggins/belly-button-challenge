# Belly-Button Challenge

## Description
The Belly-Button Challenge project aims to build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The project is inspired by the study "A Jungle in There: Bacteria in Belly Buttons are Highly Diverse, but Predictable" by Hulcr, J. et al. (2012).
